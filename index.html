    <h1>An AAC for watching Soccer</h1>
    <h4>Soccer games are often quite emotional. The game can break your heart, or lead you into
        giddy euphoria. Fans should all have a way to communicate the emotions they're feeling 
        throughout the game. This AAC allows the user to express key positive and negative emotional
        reactions typical in a game. The user must enter their team, because teams have different 
        songs for their players. Individual songs are not implemeted at this time. Also, different 
        colors may be happy or sad to different teams. For example, a fan of Tottenham Hotspur will
        likely hate red because it is the color of their rival team, Arsenal.
        <br>
        A final prototype of this would also feature animations and would likely be hooked up to bigger
        buttons that are not mousepads. It should be satisfying to express euphoria, so there should
        be animations as well. Furthermore, it should be customizable in terms of your own personal appearance.
        Most of the pictures I used were men, and people might not feel truly represented by this.
